# MarginalDistributionPlot

Marginal Distribution plots is useful exploratory data anaylsis especially when you have many variables which makes it hard to see data visualization. The main idea is to select a representative variables to actually look at their distributions. Selecting representative variables is based on one-dimensional summary statistic of each variable such as mean, standard deviation, etc. 
For a detailed discussion of Marginal Distribution Plots see section 4.1 of
`Object_Oriented_Data_Analysis`_.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
